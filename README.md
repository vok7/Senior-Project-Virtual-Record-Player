# Senior-Project-Virtual-Record-Player

Our senior project tackles nistalga with a moden twist. Our modern-day record player brings a touch of magic to music listening by simply wave an album cover, key fob, or rfid card over the wooden box which instantly starts playing the song, album or playlist coded in the rfid!

We used Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), the same technology found in contactless credit cards and key fobs. RFID systems consist of tiny chips embedded in objects. When scanned the module (MFRC522 module) detects the chips when nearby. Once scanned, the player automatically connects to Spotify and starts playing the linked album, playlists, or songs combining nostalgic vibes with smart technology. This product is perfect for tight living spaces like dorm rooms, or don't like the hassle of purchasing expensive vynls from record stores.
